## Summary

One drawback of this site is that it does not have up to date data regarding UFO sightings. A potential recommendation for further development scraping news sources for up to date sightings and adding it to the table. I also believe moving the table to a seperate like and redirect the user to /table would clutter up the home page less. Instead can include more articles on the home page giving the site a cleaner look.
